excerpt: 'A system is said to be bistable when its moving parts can rest at two equilibrium positions. This project aims to model the characteristics of a bistable system and create a sound effect capable of emulating the sound generated by a bistable membrane, by taking advantage of the nonlinearities that characterize this system.'

A system is said to be bistable when its moving parts can rest at two equilibrium positions. This project aims to model the characteristics of a bistable system and create a sound effect capable of emulating the sound generated by a bistable membrane, by taking advantage of the nonlinearities that characterize this system.

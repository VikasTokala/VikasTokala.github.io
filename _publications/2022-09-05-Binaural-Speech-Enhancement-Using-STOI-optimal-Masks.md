permalink: /publication/2022-09-05-Binaural-Speech-Enhancement-Using-STOI-optimal-Masks
excerpt: 'In this paper, we consider the extension to the task of binaural speech enhancement in which the spatial information is known to be important to speech understanding and therefore should be preserved by the enhancement processing. Masks are estimated for each of the binaural channels individually and a Ôbetter-ear listening&apos; mask is computed by choosing the maximum of the two masks. The estimated mask is used to supply probability information about the speech presence in each time-frequency bin to an Optimally-modified Log Spectral Amplitude (OM-LSA) enhancer. '

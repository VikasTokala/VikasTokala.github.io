2022-09-05	Binaural Speech Enhancement Using STOI-optimal Masks	2022 International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)	"In this paper, we consider the extension to the task of binaural speech enhancement in which the spatial information is known to be important to speech understanding and therefore should be preserved by the enhancement processing. Masks are estimated for each of the binaural channels individually and a 'better-ear listening' mask is computed by choosing the maximum of the two masks. The estimated mask is used to supply probability information about the speech presence in each time-frequency bin to an Optimally-modified Log Spectral Amplitude (OM-LSA) enhancer. "	"V. Tokala, M.

This project aims to model the characteristics of a bistable system and create a sound effect capable of emulating the sound generated by a bistable membrane, by taking advantage of the nonlinearities that characterize this system."
